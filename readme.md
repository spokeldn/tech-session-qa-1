# QA Tech Session

Hi, hopefully you've been sent this repo during the recruitment process for an QA Engineering position at Spoke. This is the framework we'd like you to use to complete a small technical task which should take about 30 minutes.

Please make sure before the session you have downloaded this repo and can run it on your local machine. 

Make sure you are in a comfortable and quiet place to complete the task, if you have any questions before the session reach out to your contact and we will do our best to answer.

When you join the call with our engineers you will provide you with the tast to complete.

We'll repeat this during the session but please ask questions and don't worry about having to use Google or Stack Overflow to complete the task, this is a normal part of development as long as you are clear throughout what you are trying to accomplish.

We're looking forward to our call.
Spoke Engineering
